			<p>
				I'm a web development enthusiast with a particular knack for design, currently working
				through my ATA in Web & Cloud Development. I enjoy the creative process of making websites
				look good and function well, using CSS and JavaScript to bring designs to life.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through my studies, I've dived deep into JavaScript with a class project that really opened
				my eyes to the power of the language. This experience led me to work on an e-commerce
				frontend mockup site on my own time to sharpen my skills. While I've also been introduced to
				frameworks like React and Angular, my current focus is on getting a strong handle on
				JavaScript before branching out further.
			</p>
			<p>
				The exciting part of web development for me is the diversity of projects I get to work on;
				I'm not tied to any one industry. I love learning new things and applying them to different
				kinds of websites. To stay on top of new developments, I regularly follow developers and
				read articles to solve problems and discover new tech insights.
			</p>
			<p>
				Outside of my coursework, I've enjoyed making small games and website projects to practice
				my skills. My latest projects include a Wordguess game and an Ecommerce site frontend.
			</p>
			<p>
				As I look to the future, I'm excited to join a team where I can contribute, learn, and grow.
				If you're looking for someone who's passionate about web design and development and loves to
				learn and create, let's get in touch!
